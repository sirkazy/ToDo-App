Todo App

A simple and robust Todo application built with React that allows you to manage your tasks, view detailed information, search/filter tasks, and toggle between light and dark modes. The app fetches initial tasks from an external API and stores user data in local storage for persistence.

## Features

  - **View Tasks:** See a list of tasks with details such as title, status, and user ID.
  - **Add Tasks:** Create new tasks using an easy-to-use dialog form.
  - **Toggle Status:** Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with a single click.
  - **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted tasks with a simple delete button.
  
- **Task Details**
  - View detailed information about a task by clicking on it.

- **Search & Filter**
  - **Search:** Quickly find tasks by title or status.
  - **Filter:** Filter tasks based on their status (All, Complete, Incomplete).

- **Dark Mode Toggle**
  - Switch between light and dark themes seamlessly.

- **Local Storage Persistence**
  - Your tasks and theme preferences are saved locally, so your data persists across sessions.

- **External API Integration**
  - Fetches an initial list of tasks from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).
